## Introduction

As part of LMGame initiative, this repo provides an easy solution of deploying computer use gaming agents (CUAs) that run on your PC and laptops.

Current features:

- Gaming agents for grid-based games (2048, Candy Crush, Sokoban, Tetris).
- Gaming agents for Platformer and Atari games (Super Mario Bros).
- Gaming agents for visual novel detective games (Ace Attorney).

## Games

### Super Mario Bros (1985 by Nintendo)

#### Game Installation

Install your Super Mario Bros game. In our demo, we adopt [SuperMarioBros-C](https://github.com/MitchellSternke/SuperMarioBros-C).

Navigate to the repo and follow the installation instructions.

#### Launch Gaming Agent

1. Once the game is built, download and move the ROM file:
```
mv path-to-your-ROM-file/"Super Mario Bros. (JU) (PRG0) [!].nes" $YOUR_WORKPLACE/SuperMarioBros-C/build/
```

2. Launch the game with
```
cd $YOUR_WORKPLACE/SuperMarioBros-C/build
./smbc
```

3. Full screen the game by pressing `F`. You should be able to see:

<p align="center">
<img src="../assets/super_mario_bros/home.png" alt="super_mario" width="400" align="center">
</p>

4. Open another screen, launch your agent in terminal with
```
cd $YOUR_WORKPLACE/GamingAgent
python games/superMario/mario_agent.py --api_provider {your_favorite_api_provider} --model_name {official_model_codename}
```

5. Due to concurrency issue, sometimes the agent will temporarily pause your game by pressing `Enter`. To avoid the issue, you can launch the agent only after entering the game upon seeing:

<p align="center">
<img src="../assets/super_mario_bros/level_1.png" alt="super_mario_level_1" width="400" align="center">
</p>

⚠️ Due to concurrency, deploying the agent with high-end models (and a large number of workers) could incur higher cost.

#### Other command options
```
--concurrency_interval: Interval in seconds between starting workers.

--api_response_latency_estimate: Estimated API response latency in seconds.

--policy: 'long', 'short', 'alternate' or 'mixed'. In 'long' or 'short' modes only those workers are enabled.
```

#### Build your own policy


You can implement your own policy in `mario_agent.py`! Deploying high-concurrency strategy with short-term planning streaming workers vs. low-concurrency strategy with long-term planning workers, or a mix of both.

In our early experiments, 'alternate' policy performs well. Try it yourself and find out which one works better!



### Sokoban 1989 (Modified)

#### Game Installation

Install your Sokoban game. Our implementation is modified from the [sokoban](https://github.com/morenod/sokoban).

#### Launch Gaming Agent

1. Launch the game with
```
cd $YOUR_WORKPLACE/GamingAgent
python games/sokoban/sokoban.py
```

You should be able to see the first level:

<p align="center">
<img src="../assets/sokoban/level1.png" alt="sokoban_level1" width="400" align="center">
</p>


2. Open another terminal screen, launch your agent in terminal with
```
python games/sokoban/sokoban_agent.py
```
#### Other command options
```
--api_provider: API provider to use.

--model_name: Model name.

--modality: Modality used, choice of ["text-only", "vision-text"].

--thinking: Whether to use deep thinking. (Special for anthropic models)

--starting_level: Starting level for the Sokoban game.

--num_threads: Number of parallel threads to launch. default=10.
```
⚠️ To turn off self-consistency, set `num_threads` to 1.

### 2048

2048 is a sliding tile puzzle game where players merge numbered tiles to reach the highest possible value. In our demo, we adopt and modify [2048-Pygame](https://github.com/rajitbanerjee/2048-pygame) 

#### Launch Gaming Agent

Run the 2048 game with a defined window size:
```sh
python games/game_2048/game_logic.py -wd 600 -ht 600
```
<p align="center">
<img src="../assets/2048/2048_sample.png" alt="2048" width="400" align="center">
</p>

Use **Ctrl** to restart the game and the **arrow keys** to move tiles strategically.

Start the AI agent to play automatically:

```sh
python games/game_2048/2048_agent.py
```


#### Other command options
```
--api_provider: API provider to use.

--model_name: Model name.

--modality: Modality used, choice of ["text-only", "vision-text"].

--thinking: Whether to use deep thinking. (Special for anthropic models)

--num_threads: Number of parallel threads to launch. default=1.

```


### Tetris

#### Game Installation

Install your Tetris game. In our demo, we adopt [Python-Tetris-Game-Pygame](https://github.com/rajatdiptabiswas/tetris-pygame).

#### Launch Gaming Agent

1. Launch the game with
```
cd $YOUR_WORKPLACE/Python-Tetris-Game-Pygame
python main.py
```

⚠️ In your Tetris implementation, Modify game speed to accomodate for AI gaming agent latency. For example, in the provided implementation, navigate to `main.py`, line 23: change event time to 500~600ms.

You should be able to see:

<p align="center">
<img src="../assets/tetris/gameplay.png" alt="tetris_game" width="400" align="center">
</p>

2. Adjust Agent's Field of Vision. Either full screen your game or adjust screen region in `/games/tetris/workers.py`, line 67 to capture only the gameplay window. For example, in `Python-Tetris-Game-Pygame` with MacBook Pro, change the line to `region = (0, 0, screen_width // 32 * 9, screen_height // 32 * 20)`.

3. Open another screen, launch your agent in terminal with
```
cd $YOUR_WORKPLACE/GamingAgent
python games/tetris/tetris_agent.py
```

#### Other command options
```
--api_provider: API provider to use.

--model_name: Model name (has to come with vision capability).

--concurrency_interval: Interval in seconds between consecutive workers.

--api_response_latency_estimate: Estimated API response latency in seconds.

--policy: 'fixed', only one policy is supported for now.
```

#### Build your own policy

Currently we find single-worker agent is able to make meaningful progress in the Tetris game. If the gaming agent spawns multiple independent workers, they don't coordinate well. We will work on improving the agent and gaming policies. We also welcome your thoughts and contributions.

### Candy Crush

#### Game Test

You can freely test the game agent on the [online version of Candy Crush](https://candy-crush-gg.github.io/).

#### Launch Gaming Agent

The example below demonstrates Level 1 gameplay on the online version of Candy Crush.

<p align="center">
  <img src="../assets/candy/candy_game.png" alt="Candy Crush Game" width="400">
</p>

#### Setup Instructions

1. Adjust the agent's field of vision  
   To enable the agent to reason effectively, you need to crop the Candy Crush board and convert it into text. Adjust the following parameters:
   - `--crop_left`, `--crop_right`, `--crop_top`, `--crop_bottom` to define the board cropping area from the image.
   - `--grid_rows`, `--grid_cols` to specify the board dimensions.  
   Check the output in `./cache/candy_crush/annotated_cropped_image.png` to verify the adjustments.

2. Launch the agent  
   Open a terminal window and run the following command to start the agent:
   ```bash
   cd $YOUR_WORKPLACE/GamingAgent
   python games/candy/candy_agent.py

#### Other command options
```
--api_provider: API provider to use.

--model_name: Model name (has to come with vision capability).

--modality: Modality used, choice of ["text-only", "vision-text"].

--thinking: Whether to use deep thinking.(Special for anthropic models)

```
#### Build Your Own Policy

The Candy Crush game agent has two workers: one extracts board information from images and converts it into text, and the other plays the game. The AI agent follows a simple prompt to play Candy Crush but performs surprisingly well. Feel free to create and implement your own policy to improve its gameplay.

### Ace Attorney

Ace Attorney is a visual novel adventure game where players take on the role of a defense attorney, gathering evidence and cross-examining witnesses to prove their client's innocence.

#### Launch Gaming Agent

1. Launch the agent with:
```bash
python games/ace_attorney/ace_agent.py
```

#### Command Options
```
--api_provider: API provider to use (e.g., "anthropic").

--model_name: Model name (e.g., "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219").

--modality: Modality used, choice of ["text-only", "vision-text", "vision-only"].

--thinking: Whether to use deep thinking (Special for anthropic models).

--episode_name: Name of the current episode being played (default: "The_First_Turnabout").

--num_threads: Number of parallel threads to launch (default: 1).
```

#### Features

The Ace Attorney agent includes several specialized workers:

- Evidence Worker: Record evidence in the game
- Vision-Only Worker: Processes visual information from the game
- Short-Term Memory Worker: Maintains recent game context
- Long-Term Memory Worker: Stores game conversations and evidences
- Memory Retrieval Worker: Combine short-term memory and long-term memory together

The agent uses a majority voting system to make decisions and includes special handling for:
- Skip conversations
- End statements
- Evidence presentation
- Dialog management

#### Build Your Own Policy

The agent's architecture allows for customization of:
- Decision-making logic
- Memory management
- Evidence handling
- Dialog processing

You can modify the workers in `games/ace_attorney/workers.py` to implement your own strategies for case-solving and evidence management.
