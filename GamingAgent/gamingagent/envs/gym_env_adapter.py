class GymEnvAdapter:
    """
    Adapts a standard Gymnasium environment for use with the GamingAgent framework.

    The adapter handles several key responsibilities:
    1.  Loading game-specific configurations (e.g., action mappings, stuck detection parameters)
        from a JSON file (`game_env_config.json`).
    2.  Managing episode lifecycle: resetting state, incrementing steps.
    3.  Creating agent-facing `Observation` objects (potentially including image rendering
        via `env_utils.create_board_image_2048` and textual representations) based on the
        raw environment state and specified observation mode.
    4.  Logging detailed step-by-step data for each episode to a JSONL file.
    5.  Mapping agent action strings (e.g., "up", "left") to environment-specific action indices.
    6.  Performing stuck detection by hashing observations and terminating if the observation
        remains unchanged for a configured number of steps.
    7.  Calculating a performance score for each step (currently mirrors reward, but extensible).
    8.  Collecting results from all episodes within a run.
    9.  Generating a final JSON summary (`gym_run_summary.json`) for the entire run, including
        run settings, individual episode results, and overall statistics (mean, std, min, max).

    Key Parameters:
        game_name (str): The internal name of the game (e.g., "twenty_forty_eight").
        observation_mode (str): How the agent observes the environment. 
                                Options: "vision", "text", "both".
        agent_cache_dir (str): Directory to store episode logs and generated observation images.
        game_specific_config_path (Optional[str]): Path to the game's JSON configuration file 
                                         (e.g., `game_env_config.json`) which contains action
                                         mappings and other game-specific settings for the adapter.
        max_steps_for_stuck (Optional[int]): Number of consecutive unchanged observations before
                                           the episode is terminated due to being stuck. Overrides
                                           value from `game_specific_config_path` if provided.
